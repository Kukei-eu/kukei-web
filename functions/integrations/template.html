	<p>Having cool web search engine is cool but if it doesn't work with any muscle memory then you'd always end up using your general use default search engine.</p>
	<p>Here are some tips how to integrate kukei.eu in your daily work:</p>

	<h2>Firefox - add a shortcut</h2>
	<p>If you use Firefox as your main browser, you are lucky. Firefox has an amazing `opensearch` integration/UX.</p>
	<p>Kukei.eu supports opensearch standard so once you visit the website once, you can configure an alias (e.g. @ku) which you can later use to search via kukei.eu instead of your default engine.</p>
	<p>More information on how to configure it are available on <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firefox website</a></p>

	<h2>Siri shortcut</h2>
	<p>For macOS users there's also a nice way to have kukei.eu always available, no matter what context.</p>
	<p>You can use a Siri Shortcut that I prepared for you. Here's how to use it:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Install the shortcut on your Mac or iOS by clicking on this lik: <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fce98411df6a49f0bbd9fb57b8a6fa3b" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fce...</a></li>
		<li>If you prefer speaking or writing to Siri, you're done. Just say "Siri kukei" and then tell/write your search query</li>
		<li>If you're a typing person like me, go to Shortcuts app, double click the `kukei` shortcut, click the small (i) icon and there you can add your own keyboard shortcut (I use ctr + option + k, doesn't conflict with anything)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Here's how it works in the end on macOS:</p>
